# Unity Space Shooter 2D (2025)

A beginner-friendly 2D space shooter game built with Unity 6.  


## üéÆ How to Run

Open the project in Unity 2022+ or Unity 6.

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open it in Unity Hub  
3. Hit ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play in the Unity Editor

## üß† What I‚Äôve Practiced

- Scene organization in Unity
- Using C# scripts with `MonoBehaviour`
- Managing assets (sprites, scripts, components)


## ‚úÖ Features Completed

### üß± Feature 1: Infinite Parallax Scrolling Background
This feature implements a multi-layered scrolling background to simulate depth using the parallax effect.

What I did:
	‚Ä¢	Added multiple background image layers (e.g. stars, planets, distant space).
	‚Ä¢	Each layer is assigned a different movement speed to create a depth illusion.
	‚Ä¢	Created a ParallaxBackground.cs script attached to background layers.
	‚Ä¢	Calculated background width using sprite.texture.width / pixelsPerUnit for seamless loop.
	‚Ä¢	Repositioned backgrounds when they move off-screen to simulate infinite scrolling.

What I learned:
	‚Ä¢	How to access and manipulate SpriteRenderer in Unity.
	‚Ä¢	Using Time.deltaTime and transform.position to implement smooth movement.
	‚Ä¢	Structuring reusable MonoBehaviour scripts for environmental effects.
